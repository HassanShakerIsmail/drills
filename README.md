# drills with various random small stuff i've worked on while learning c++ from Bjarne strousoups book " programming principles in c++"
many of these drills have been done ages ago when i first started coding, and thus will have archaiec styles, no commentary, etc.
unfortunately due to resetting my pc recently, many of the drills from intermediate chapters have been lost.
